Multiple authors with the same or similar names

Be able to sort information based on the book title, author, genre, and category

You might also want to use models to represent selection-list options (e.g. like a drop-down list of choices), rather than hard-coding the choices into the website itself â€” this is recommended when all the options aren't known up front or may change. A good example is a genre (e.g. fantasy, science fiction, etc.).
